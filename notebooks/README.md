## description

MA.ipynb : Data normalizer. Output is used in MA_LSTM.ipynb

MA_LSTM.ipynb : The optimal solution. Data should be normalized by MA.ipynb before usage.

MA_LSTM_2.ipynb : The solution to be benchmarked with

Detailed descriptions can be found in each notebook

## how to use

1- A dataset needs to be prepared

Data may be both univariate or multivariate (preferred)

Data may be extracted from a real VM or may be generated by data_generator.py containing in the main folder.

Data needs to be represented to the neural network via a CSV file

2- Normalize the data via MA.ipynb
Data will be exported to MA.csv

3- Run MA_LSTM.ipynb with the normalized data

4- (optional) Benchmark

the initial raw data can be fed to MA_LSTM_2.ipynb to see the results of a typical solution

results can be visually compared via the visual charts in each notebook
